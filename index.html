		<p>Ánanda Márga is an international organization which teaches meditation and the tantra yoga lifestyle — and
			provides social service — all over the world.</p>
		<p>
			The meditation and tantra yoga lifestyle are part of a complete, modernized system, which promotes physical,
			mental and spiritual health and development.
			Some of the teachings are as old as 7000 years, such as tantric and yogic meditation techniques, yoga
			postures, chanting and dancing.
		</p>
		<p>The modernization clarifies and elaborates the tantric and yogic teachings with perspectives adjusted for the
			modern, globalized human being.</p>
		<p>
			The idea of ahiḿsá, non violence, explained in a practical way, is not only about not harming harmless
			beings, but expanded into serving the universe, protecting all life.
			Therefore, Ánanda Márga practices both spirituality and service to the universe, very sincerely.
			Furthermore, humanity is being served in all possible ways of creating a better world, such as with
			environmental activism, relief work, as well as actively attempting to eradicate world problems such as
			starvation, poverty, suppression, oppression, repression and exploitation.
		</p>
		<p>The tantric and yogic practices also serve humanity, by improving physical, mental and spiritual health and
			development. For the practitioners, tantric and yogic practices go hand in hand with serving the universe,
			since these things enhance one another. Therefore, service to the universe is a vital part of tantric and
			yogic practices.</p>
		<p>
			The modernized philosophy also explain the tantric and yogic philosophy with scientific concepts and
			language. Evolution, the central nervous system, sexism, racism, economy, politics, arts, music, and even
			the future of society, are all covered with the tantra yogic perspective of self-realization and the welfare
			of the universe.
